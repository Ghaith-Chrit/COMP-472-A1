To run the project, the newest version of Anaconda is installed, which can be obtained from the following link: `https://www.anaconda.com/download`. Once it is installed, go into the Anaconda Powershell Prompt and ensure Python 3.11 is installed with `python -V`. If it is not, add the Python installation to your path. 

Install `graphviz` version 9.0.0 using the instructions found at `https://graphviz.org/download/` and ensure it is added to your path (assuming a Windows machine) at `C:\Program Files\Graphviz\bin`. If using a different operating system, add it to the path where the Graphviz bin folder is located, as appropriate.

Following that, you can install the necessary dependencies:
`conda install pandas`
`conda install sklearn`
`conda install matplotlib`
`conda install numpy`
`conda install imageio`
`conda install graphviz`
`conda install python-graphviz`

Finally, to run the code, run `py main.py` from within Anaconda Powershell Prompt.
